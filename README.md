# Connect four
## 0. Abstract

ℹ️ Create a _Connect four_ game app. An example of the desired result can be found [here](https://solitariosonline.es/conecta-4).

## 1. Requirements
* `7` x `6` board (`7` on "x" axis and `6` on the "y" axis).
* Red and yellow chips. The first turn always starts with red, the second yellow, the third red, and so on.
* It is not necessary to implement a functionality that allows you to play against the application. Two real people are supposed to play alternately.
* When a column is selected, the chip is placed in the last lower place.
* As long as the game is not finished or restarted, the number of games won by each player will be saved.
* There should be a button to restart the ongoing match.
* There should be a button to restart win/loss counter.
* Any additional features are welcome.
